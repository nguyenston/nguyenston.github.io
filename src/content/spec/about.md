# Hello, I'm Nguyen Phuc Nguyen

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Systems Engineering at Boston University with a background in Computer Science and Physics. My research focuses on developing interpretable machine learning models, designing efficient algorithms, and building automated ML pipelines for large-scale data applications.

## Education

* **Ph.D. in Systems Engineering** | Boston University (Expected 2026)
* **B.S. in Computer Science** & **B.A. in Physics** | Syracuse University (2021)

## Research & Professional Experience

Currently, I work as a Graduate Research Assistant at the **Paschalidis NOC Lab**, where I apply machine learning to clinical and theoretical problems.

* **Clinical ML Pipelines**: I built and deployed an ML pipeline trained on a 100,000-patient dataset that currently runs weekly inference for a clinical trial on hypertension prescription at BMC. Additionally, I engineered a data pipeline processing a 10-year dataset (30,000 appointments) to predict missed CT screenings.
* **Algorithm Design**: I formulated a spectral algorithm for discovering latent policies from demonstrations, which guarantees global convergence in a single data pass, overcoming the pitfalls of Expectation-Maximization (EM) methods.
* **ACDC**: I helped designing and implementing a flexible framework for discovering latent processes, with successful applications in bioinformatics (mutation analysis) and remote sensing (hyperspectral unmixing).

## Technical Projects

Beyond my academic research, I enjoy tinkering with new languages and frameworks to build open-source tools.

### [Mokuro Library](https://github.com/nguyenston/mokuro-library)
*Full-stack, Dockerized Web Application*

A centralized, multi-user comic library with embedded OCR data. It features a Fastify/Prisma backend and a SvelteKit frontend.
* **Key Features**: Exposes a REST API for user-scoped resource management and implements a custom in-place web reader for editing OCR text and bounding boxes directly on the server.
* **Technical challenges**: Implemented a "faux-absolute" positioning system using relative CSS and negative margins to resolve DOM continuity conflicts between frontend layout requirements and Yomitan's text scanning.

### [Matter Phase Simulation](https://github.com/nguyenston/Van_Der_Waals_Interactions)
*Rust / Systems Simulation*

Developed a particle simulation in Rust using the Bevy UI to explore physical systems. Implemented an efficient grid method to visualize complex phenomena such as the breakdown of the ideal gas law, crystalline formation, and annealing processes.

### [Quantum Virtual Machine (QVIM)](https://github.com/nguyenston/QViM)
*Julia / Metaprogramming*

Designed a domain-specific language (DSL) in Julia using meta-programming to create intuitive syntax for defining quantum logic circuits. The project includes an efficient simulator with gate operations optimized via basis change.
