# Hello, I'm Nguyen Nguyen

I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Systems Engineering at Boston University, with 3 years of experience in data-driven modeling and interpretable machine learning.

My work involves building and deploying automated ML pipelines for large-scale data applications. At the Paschalidis NOC Lab, I've developed novel algorithms for statistical learning and built data pipelines to predict clinical outcomes for thousands of patients.

## Side Projects

Beyond my research, I enjoy building practical, open-source tools.

* **[Mokuro Library](https://github.com/nguyenston/mokuro-library)**
    A self-hosted, multi-user web application (Fastify/Prisma backend, SvelteKit frontend) that hosts a centralized manga library with embedded OCR data.

## Skills

The programming languages I'm currently most familiar with are **Python, Julia, Rust, and JavaScript**.
